`fastlane` is a tool for iOS, Mac, and Android developers to automate tedious tasks like generating screenshots, dealing with provisioning profiles, and releasing your application.

Use a lane to define your process:

```ruby
lane :beta do
  increment_build_number
  cocoapods
  match
  testflight
  sh "./customScript.sh"
  slack
end
```

Then to deploy a new 'beta' version of your app just run
`fastlane beta`. :rocket:

## Installation

    sudo gem install fastlane --verbose

Make sure you have the latest version of the Xcode command line tools installed:

    xcode-select --install

If you experience slow launch times of fastlane, try running:

    gem cleanup

**System Requirements:** `fastlane` requires Mac OS X or Linux with Ruby 2.0.0 or above

If you'd like to take a look at a project already using `fastlane` check out [fastlane-examples](https://github.com/fastlane/examples) which includes `fastlane` setups by Wikipedia, Product Hunt, MindNode, and more.

## Quick Start

`fastlane`'s setup assistant creates all the necessary files to get you started, using existing app metadata from iTunes Connect or Google Play.

- `cd [your_project_folder]`
- `fastlane init`
- Follow the setup assistant to configure your app
- Further customise the Ruby based `Fastfile` with additional [actions](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Actions.md)

For more details, check out the [fastlane guide](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/master/fastlane/docs/Guide.md).

## Available Commands

Typically you'll use `fastlane` by triggering individual lanes:

    fastlane [lane_name]

#### Other Commands

- `fastlane actions`: List all available `fastlane` actions
- `fastlane action [action_name]`: Shows a more detailed description of an action
- `fastlane lanes`: Lists all available lanes with description
- `fastlane list`: Lists all available lanes without description
- `fastlane new_action`: Create a new action *(integration)* for fastlane

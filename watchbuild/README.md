###### Get a notification once your iTunes Connect build is finished processing

<img src="assets/screenshot.png" width=350>

When you upload a new binary from Xcode to iTunes Connect, you have to wait until it's done processing before you can submit it to the App Store.

As the [#iosprocessingtime](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iosprocessingtime) varies from a few minutes to multiple hours, it's easy to forget to check iTunes Connect to see if the build is ready. WatchBuild lets you know as soon as it is done.

WatchBuild is a simple standalone tool that shows a notification once your newly uploaded build was successfully processed by iTunes Connect.

Once the build is ready to be pushed to TestFlight or for review, you get a OS X notification. You can even directly click on the notification to open the build on iTunes Connect.

### Why use WatchBuild?

WatchBuild is a standalone tool and can be used without any of the other [fastlane tools](https://fastlane.tools). This is *big*, since you can use WatchBuild also if you use Xcode to upload your app.

This tool is not a replacement for [deliver](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/deliver) (Upload metadata and builds to iTunes Connect) or [pilot](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/pilot) (Upload and distribute new builds to TestFlight), but is meant as a small helpful utility with the main purpose to wait for the binary processing to be finished.
